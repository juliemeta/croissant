      <h1>What is a croissant 🥐</h1>
      <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Viennoiserie inspired by the shape of
        the Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
        dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.
        <br />The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
        in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
        a puff pastry.
